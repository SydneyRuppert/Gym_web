                <p class="text-align-left"> We are a woman owned and operated yoga studio but we encourage everyone to walk through our doors
                    and experience the peace and serenity that any of our classes offer. The owners, Sara and Jessica, are natives to Laguna Beach
                    and they wanted to share a peaceful, zen space for their community to come and not only do yoga but have a place that felt like family.
                    They decided on the name breathe after Sara lost her father and realized just breathing helped her regain control of her life again.</p>
